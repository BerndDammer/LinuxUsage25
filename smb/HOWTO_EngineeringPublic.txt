HOWTO use engineering public folder on engineering file server

Create mountpoint /media/EngineeringPublic (you may change that if you like, but also change the path in fstab below)

Add line in /etc/fstab (\040 is a whitespace):
//10.0.0.42/engineering\040public	/media/EngineeringPublic	cifs	username=<user>,password=<password>,noperm 0 0

Mount the public drive (will be automatically mounted after reboot):
sudo mount /media/EngineeringPublic
